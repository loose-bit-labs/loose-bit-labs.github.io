# Overview 

Here are a number of different AI related projects and experiments. 
Some of the projects are still private repositories I'm working towards making public.
There's quite a back log to catch up on, so please be patient!

A lot of the verbiage is PHI3 spew. Though generated on the project documentation it is definitely state-of-the-art if you catch my drift.
I've tried to correct some of the more glarings, but this is only meant as an overview in any case. Please consult each project for more accurate documentation.

# Face Mesh Workflow with Depth Estimation using MediaPipe, Zoe, and Midas
<img src="pix/ss/face-mesh-workflow.png" class="right"/>

This workflow leverages [MediaPipe](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/guide) to detect faces in images while integrating depth estimations from both [Zoe](https://github.com/isl-org/ZoeDepth) and [Midas](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS). The workflow is designed for ease of use with a simple interface, allowing users to upload an image and view the detected face along with its depth estimation in 3D.

## HuggingFace Demo

The live demo is available on [HuggingFace.co](https://huggingface.co/spaces/verkaDerkaDerk/face-mesh-workflow).

## Features of This Workflow

- **Face Detection**: MediaPipe is used to detect faces in an uploaded image, providing facial landmarks and pose information.
- **Depth Estimation Integration**: The workflow allows combining depth estimations from Zoe or Midas with the detected face's 3D model for a comprehensive visualization of both facial features and their spatial orientation.
- **Adjustable Spinning Direction**: Due to differences in Y axis orientations between this setup and Blender, you can spin the 3D view as needed (usually counterclockwise) by adjusting the display settings or modifying image preprocessing steps if necessary.

# Muscle LLM
<img src="pix/mm-00026-350228160.png" class="right"/>

Originally I was missing the character MuscleMan from binging the Regular show, so I wanted to try to recreate him using a local LLM. The results was [Muscle LLM](https://github.com/luckybit4755/muscleLLM/blob/main/). Though I was never able to full get the conversational history (RAG) working as I wanted it was still a pretty fun experiment. 

Join the thrilling world of LangChain and LlamaCpp as we embark on a journey to unlock the potentials of AI conversations with our small experiment. Our innovative project combines two distinct personalities, Muscle Man and AI Assistant, in order to explore the contextual capabilities and document-based features of LangChain.

If you're passionate about advancing conversational technologies or simply want to contribute ideas for enhancing our experiment, we warmly welcome your participation! Let us collectively push boundaries and discover new horizons through this collaborative endeavor.

In the spirit of exploration, we currently feature two personalities in Muscle Man and AI Assistant roles. Interested individuals can participate by submitting their ideas or suggestions for improvement using one of the following commands:

1. `./muscleLLM.py -m models/StableBeluga-13B-GGML/stablebeluga-13b.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin` 
   Using llama.cpp and installing dependencies from requirements.txt

2. `./muscleLLM.py -m [yada-yada] -p ai`
   Installing the necessary components using pip, followed by a change in CMake arguments to enable GPU support for LlamaCpp (optional)

3. `./muscleLLM.py -k http://localhost:5001/`
   Running Muscle Man with an external context store and Kolboldcpp integration

The experiment also provides the ability to run locally using a GGML model, as shown by the example below:

```bash
./muscleLLM.py -m starling-lm-7b-alpha.Q8_0.gguf -p starling --llama_cpp_max_tokens 2048 --http 13031
```

Here's a glimpse of the exciting ideas that could elevate our experiment to new heights:

1. Research Assistant: Create an AI persona who acts as a research assistant, helping participants explore various topics and providing knowledge-based assistance while maintaining contextual awareness using LangChain's capabilities.
2. Multi-Actor Stories: Develop an immersive multi-actor storytelling experience where Muscle Man, the AI Assistant, and other unique personas interact to create dynamic narratives with evolving plotlines. This would allow participants to contribute their creativity in shaping these interactive tales while exploring LangChain's features further.

# Piper (fork)

https://github.com/luckybit4755/piper/tree/http-server-json-response

[Piper](https://github.com/luckybit4755/piper/tree/http-server-json-response) is an exceptional text-to-speech (TTS) model that has been meticulously optimized for performance on Raspberry Pi 4 devices, seamlessly integrating with your fLimfLaMs ecosystem. By expanding its capabilities to support JSON request and response formats based on the Content-Type header, we've enabled a more versatile interaction style, allowing users to specify voice characteristics directly within their requests.

In addition, we have refined the TTS engine by modifying the voice loading process, thereby facilitating dynamic selection of voices in real-time and enhancing user experience. This adjustment allows for greater flexibility as it accommodates various language accents or speech styles to suit different users' needs. 

Furthermore, we have taken strides towards more robust text processing by incorporating the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a powerful Python library that empowers Piper with advanced natural language understanding and improved handling of extended passages of text. This integration ensures uninterrupted speech generation even for longer runs, significantly enhancing its reliability and efficiency in delivering richer auditory experiences without encountering performance limitations or crashes.
