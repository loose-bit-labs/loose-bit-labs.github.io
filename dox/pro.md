# Work History

## [Company1]: 2011 - 2024

**Role: Senior Software Engineer**

Overview: 

At [Company1], I began by contributing to the GeoDNS project and then took the lead in revitalizing the MIRO performance-based router optimizer. 
MIRO was deployed across 28 data centers worldwide, where it handled an impressive workload every minute, processing 3.5 million flows, conducting 90,000 active prefix probes, performing 275,000 traceroutes, and executing 470,000 pings.
For [Company1] Cloud Compute, I implemented a solution that enabled portal customers to graphically access their remote hosts using NoVNC.
Following the company’s acquisition and merger, I spearheaded the planning phase for integrating peering exchange support into MIRO, maintained the PacketFabric Terraform provider, and contributed to NetBox integration. 
Additionally, as a core member of the PacketFabric development team, I drove the implementation of advanced features within our scalable, automated network platform.

- Prototyped a stream registry service using Cassandra to manage media streams within the content delivery network (CDN).

## [Company2]: 2009 - 2010

**Role: Senior Java Developer**

Overview: 

The goal of the project was simple: to build a Lucene-driven Java search engine that could index JSON documents and support queries with boolean operations, synonyms, facets, and custom scoring.
Given the flexible structure of the JSON documents, we developed a path-based field naming and query definition mechanism using Spring XSD, which allowed for wildcard field name search templates. 
The system's extensibility meant that once it was up and running, any additional customization could be handled through configuration — no further coding needed.

Technologies: Java, Lucene, RabbitMQ (AMQP), Spring, Spring XSD, SpringMVC, Maven, SVN, Bamboo, Tomcat, Python, BoboBrowse, FreeMarker, Jackson, JAMon, JSON, Junit, Log4J, SLF4J, Linux (Fedora), Amazon EC2 cloud

**Role: Senior Java Developer**

Overview:

[Company3], already a leader in the anti-money laundering (AML) space, acquired my former employer [Company4] (see below) to enhance its 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) capabilities. 
I developed proxies to seamlessly integrate the AML product with KYC and various third-party web services.

## [Company4]: 2000 - 2006

Roles: 

- **Senior Java Developer** (January 2004 to February 2006)
- **Senior C++ Developer** (August 2002 to January 2004)
- **C++ Developer** (January 2000 to August 2002)

Overview:

The initially technology was a hierarchical search engine for video metadata, which evolved into an ontology-based semantic search technology with advanced features like relationship analysis, text classification, and named entity identification. 
My role was hands-on, coding initially in Java, then PHP, and predominantly in C++ for the semantic backend. 
I designed a modular pipeline system in C++ that could be dynamically configured per request to manage search, document annotation, and ontological traversal. 
Later, I ported significant portions of this system to Java. 
Although the semantic framework was eventually tailored for a specific "Know Your Customer" (KYC) use case, its value was significant enough to contribute to the company's acquisition.
