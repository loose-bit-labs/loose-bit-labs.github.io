<h2 id="internap-2011---2024">Internap: 2011 - 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unitas Global (2022) acquired Internap networking business.</li>
<li>PacketFabric (2023) merged with Unitas Global.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Role: Senior Software Engineer</strong></p>
<p>Overview:</p>
<p>At Internap, I began by contributing to the GeoDNS project and then took the lead in revitalizing the MIRO performance-based router optimizer. MIRO was deployed across 28 data centers worldwide, where it handled an impressive workload every minute, processing 3.5 million flows, conducting 90,000 active prefix probes, performing 275,000 traceroutes, and executing 470,000 pings. For Internap Cloud Compute, I implemented a solution that enabled portal customers to graphically access their remote hosts using NoVNC. Following the company’s acquisition and merger, I spearheaded the planning phase for integrating peering exchange support into MIRO, maintained the PacketFabric Terraform provider, and contributed to NetBox integration. Additionally, as a core member of the PacketFabric development team, I drove the implementation of advanced features within our scalable, automated network platform.</p>

<h2 id="how-stuff-works-international-hswi-inc-2009---2010">“How Stuff Works, International” (HSWI) INC: 2009 - 2010</h2>
<p><strong>Role: Senior Java Developer</strong></p>
<p>Overview:</p>
<p>The goal of the project was simple: to build a Lucene-driven Java search engine that could index JSON documents and support queries with boolean operations, synonyms, facets, and custom scoring. Given the flexible structure of the JSON documents, we developed a path-based field naming and query definition mechanism using Spring XSD, which allowed for wildcard field name search templates. The system’s extensibility meant that once it was up and running, any additional customization could be handled through configuration — no further coding needed.</p>
<p>Technologies: Java, Lucene, RabbitMQ (AMQP), Spring, Spring XSD, SpringMVC, Maven, SVN, Bamboo, Tomcat, Python, BoboBrowse, FreeMarker, Jackson, JAMon, JSON, Junit, Log4J, SLF4J, Linux (Fedora), Amazon EC2 cloud</p>
<p>Accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provided backend search functionality for over 200k documents on ShareCare.com and DoctorOz.com.</li>
<li>Implemented distributed Lucene search on Amazon EC2 instances.</li>
<li>Developed a distributed indexing and search system, routing requests to local indexes via RabbitMQ using SpringMVC.</li>
<li>Translated JSON REST requests with a custom Spring XSD format.</li>
<li>Supported complex nested boolean queries and result scoring, built from term, prefix, and frames field searches.</li>
<li>Created custom Lucene scoring queries to boost documents based on business logic, such as “helpfulness” ratings.</li>
<li>Implemented scatter-and-gather techniques over RabbitMQ using UUID-based consistent hashing routing.</li>
<li>Designed factories and configurations for Lucene tokenizers and filters using Spring.</li>
<li>Implemented fuzzy search capabilities using MESH synonyms to refine user search terms.</li>

<li>Created fault-tolerant, multi-threaded code to handle queue server outages and automatic reconnects.</li>
<li>Developed a recommendation system using Hadoop on Amazon Elastic MapReduce.</li>
<li>Implemented a search admin console with FreeMarker to enable query debugging, index statistics, and operational management.</li>
<li>Researched and evaluated NLP technologies using OpenNLP, NLTK, MALLET, and MESH.</li>

<h2 id="semagix-inc-2000---2006">Semagix, Inc: 2000 - 2006</h2>
<p>Roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Senior Java Developer</strong> (January 2004 to February 2006)</li>
<li><strong>Senior C++ Developer</strong> (August 2002 to January 2004)</li>
<li><strong>C++ Developer</strong> (January 2000 to August 2002)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overview:</p>
<p>The initially technology was a hierarchical search engine for video metadata, which evolved into an ontology-based semantic search technology with advanced features like relationship analysis, text classification, and named entity identification. My role was hands-on, coding initially in Java, then PHP, and predominantly in C++ for the semantic backend. I designed a modular pipeline system in C++ that could be dynamically configured per request to manage search, document annotation, and ontological traversal. Later, I ported significant portions of this system to Java. Although the semantic framework was eventually tailored for a specific “Know Your Customer” (KYC) use case, its value was significant enough to contribute to the company’s acquisition.</p>
